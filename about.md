## About our Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/profile.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
My name is Aryan Mahesh. I am 17 years old and studying in Class 12. This site is a collection of my work from 2015 to the present day. I post about my embedded systems projects, sketches, astrophysics and stories that I write.
