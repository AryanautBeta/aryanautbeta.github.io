I made a couple more 3D printed minifigs. It is super fun to model, extemely tedious to edit and very satisfying to see the final result. I made an android with a very **w i d e** head and the 3D form of Kodamas - a small set of creatures from [Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke).

That's all I have for now. I will 100% be making more of these. Live long and prosper!
