Hello everyone and welcome to a very quick post on what I did for Ganesh Chaturti. It is Lord Ganesha's Birthday. Since it is a special occasion, a garland of leaves had to be hung at the front of the door. How did I make it? Well... Here's how - First thing I had to do was to collect 80 leaves form a mango tree.

Next I took the leaves  and took the tiny bit of stem attached to it and punched it through the leaf. Something like this:

\[gallery ids="497,496,500" type="rectangular"\]

 

Now I will tell you the scientific need for this garland. There are two main reasons:-

1. It normally is hung for about two days and made on the day of the festival. When leaves fall, they photosynthesise for some time. So this actually purifies the air.
2. The colour green actually reduces stress levels. So if anyone has and exam please do stare at this for an hour and proudly present a C- in your paper. Oh and this is what you need to stare at:-![search](images/search.jpg)

After making these loopy leaves, take a long string slightly bigger that the width of your front door and then...

So after doing this just hang the entire garland at the front door.

Please do try this at home next year.

So that's all for this post. Stay tuned for more!

Live long and prosper.

May the force be with you.
