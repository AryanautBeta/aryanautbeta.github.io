2020 is at the moment 13 hours from being over so here is my summary of this hellish calender abomination in one sketch. It's hard to fit everything into one drawing because so much happened so it is possible I missed a few things but I think I've got all of the major events. Let me know what I missed.

In the end this year was absolute garbage. It may not have been the worst historical year but it has been the most documented bad year. So hope you liked the sketch and let's all hope that 2021 is not as bad as this year. Good luck to everyone I guess.

That's all I have for now. Live Long and Prosper!
