A few months back my cousin (who I thank for being patient enough to watch me aim a telescope for thirty minutes) and I tried to take photos of the Moon. We were aiming for the [Tycho Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_(lunar_crater)) because it's really prominant and also just challenging enough to it fun for non astrophysics enthusiasts. However due to a large number of bees, we did not succeed. Yesterday, I decided to finish what we started and complete our noble quest (yes, I feel rediculous typing that). Here are the results -
