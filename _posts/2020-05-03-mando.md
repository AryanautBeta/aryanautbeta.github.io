I recently watched _The Mandalorian_ and I absolutely loved it. It was nothing like the new nonsense that the Star Wars movies have been taken over by. It has amazing CGI, epic dialogue and brilliant scenery. Since my dad liked it as much as I did, I decided to make this as his birthday gift.

Welp, that's all for now!

May the Force be with you.
