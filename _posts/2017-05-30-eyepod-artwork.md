So today like any other day of my summer vacation, I was just sitting on my bed with some popcorn and watching some YouTube with my little sister and I came across an animation by Walt Disney and Salvador Dali. I had already heard bout Dali's strange paintings especially of melting clocks from my mom. As I continued to watch it I kept thinking that it was weird but also somehow creative. Then I spoke to my mom about it and found a little more on it. As I read more about this style which is called surrealism, I thought of doing one just to understand the process better. Since I love making puns I made a pun while just talking to my mom and then realised that I could draw my pun! After about three tries I made my first surreal art. But before that here's a little bit on Surrealism.

Surrealism began in 1920 as a cultural movement which started in France and Belgium. Surrealism art form takes everyday objects and makes weird and at the same time interesting creatures. Normally these paintings or sketches have some meaning behind them but the one I drew doesn't. Mainly because it's a pun. Otherwise it just forms a very interesting drawing.

Here's the drawing:

Here's how I did it.

I first looked up drawings of peas in a pod. Took a while but I finally found it. Then I drew it but instead of peas, I drew eyeballs. To draw eyeballs, it took a while because well I had to look at an actual picture of an eyeball to draw it. So the whole time I was drawing the eyeballs, I was mentally vomiting. After that I used black pens to outline the drawing. Finally I coloured and shaded it with water colours. In order to make it look like the peas were replaced with eyeballs, I had to draw peas first then the eyeball details.

Well that's all for now.

Live Long and Prosper!
