Hello again everyone and welcome back to another drawing post. Today I present the cutest robot in the Star Wars universe. I'm pretty sure you guessed it. It's BB-8!!! The little beeping robot from Star Wars 7. This drawing was not done entirely by me. My friend Aayush has helped me with the colouring. By the way I have a Star Wars movie review and if you have not seen it yet, I'll leave the link at the bottom of the page. Anyway, here's the video:-
