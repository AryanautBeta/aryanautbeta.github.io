Recently, I've been reading the entire Dune saga because of how much I liked Dune (2021), so I decided to sketch out some of my favorite parts of the movie using Photoshop since I found a new set of brushes for it. 

Here's Duke Leto Atreides.

Here's Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

I've finished reading upto God-Emperor of Dune and I think the seires is fantastic. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of sci-fi. 

That's all I have for now. Live Long and Prosper!
