Inglorious Basterds has become one of my favourite movies and Tarantino one of my favourite directors, so I drew my favourite characters from the movie. Hans Landa and Also Raine. Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt are absolute amazing' to watch on screen and while I love this movie end to end, these two are the best part of it.
