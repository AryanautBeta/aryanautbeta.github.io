Our colony organised a small market for young entrepreneurs to make and sell any product of their choice. So my friend Aravind and I, inspired by an instructables.com post about rubber band guns, planned to make a variation of it.

The materials needed are:

![IMG_8596](https://aryanaut.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_8596.jpg?w=225)

- 12 inch PVC pipe(1/2 inch diameter)
- 2 binder clips
- 2 screws
- 2 washers
- A 45 or 90 degree bend
- A file
- A hacksaw blade
- A hot glue gun
- A Dremel tool( a drill)
- Some permanent markers for colouring.

Here are the steps to make it.

1. Cut 8 inches of pipe with the hacksaw blade and smoothen the ends with a file.
2. Attach the bend to the two pieces.
3. Take the file and make four grooves on the open end of the 8 inch piece.
4. Use the Dremel tool to drill holes on top and bottom of the 8 inch piece.![IMG_8604](https://aryanaut.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_8604.jpg?w=225)
5. Screw the binder clips into the holes.
6. Hot glue the clips in place so it looks something like this:![IMG_8612](https://aryanaut.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_8612.jpg?w=225)
7. Now its time to let the Picasso inside you out. Draw some cool designs like flames on the gun using the markers.

Lastly, take one rubber band and put it in the top two grooves, pull it back and lock it inside the binder clip. Do the same with the bottom, with a different rubber band.

Now just lightly press the steel handles and watch the rubber bands fly!

Our guns were a hit in our colony, and we sold all our stock, got extra orders and won a prize.
