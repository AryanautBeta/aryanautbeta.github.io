"Why on Earth should any one give a participation certificate?" I mean seriously, why give a bendable piece of paper just to inform you that you participated in a contest? Especially when you made the decision of participating. Is it just to make you feel good over umm... trying? Well, if that is the case, it isn't working. And I don't think I'm the only one who feels like this. Come on, think about it. This is what an honest participation certificate should look like - written and illustrated by me.

Anyway, that's all for now.

Live Long and Prosper!
