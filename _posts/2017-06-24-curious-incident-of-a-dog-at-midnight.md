Recently I read this book with this 'curious' (get it?)  title and I thought it was really amazing. Here's a little review on it.

The story of _The Curious Incident of the Dog at night-time_ is a very interesting, unique story since the dog is not the main part of the story. It is of a teenager Christopher Boone and his life changing incident.

Christopher Boone is an autistic, bright and observant fifteen year old. One night, his neighbour Mrs. Shears had a terrible loss in her house. Her dog, Willington, was killed with a garden fork and the first suspect was Christopher. The dog’s death was just the beginning of Christopher’s journey to find the truth of his life. He is determined to talk to his neighbours and find who killed Wellington so that his name would be cleared. But one particular neighbour had valuable information on his so claimed ‘dead’ mother. He begins to find that his father had being lying to him about something. Finally the story is flipped when the author Mark Haddon puts a huge twist into the story which filled me with shock when I read it. Now telling what it was will destroy the story for a lot of people. And also there would be no point in me recommending this book to anyone. So I’ll leave it at that.

The story is written in such a way that the title itself makes you think. This is why I am now recommending this beautifully written unique story to everyone.

Well, that's all  for now!

Stay tuned for more.

Live Long and Prosper!
