I just finished my first 3D printed object - it's a model of Jiji from _[Kiki's Delivery Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bG17OYs-GA)_. Here it is! It's about 9 centimeters tall and jet black... or shiny black... whatever kind of black you think this is -

_Jiji_

I made the entire model through blender through its sculpt mode.

I made some reference images based on some scenes from the movie. I created a side view and front view so I could get the shapes right. I also mirrored the entire model along the Z axis so that whatever I do on one side of the model happens on the other side.

The rendering is done through Blender Cycles Engine. [All hail Blender!](https://www.blender.org/)

That's all for now!
