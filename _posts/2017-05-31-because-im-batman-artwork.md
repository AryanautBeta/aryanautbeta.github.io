Out of all the MARVEL and DC comics I know, Batman has always been my favourite. I don't known why I haven't drawn him till now. But a week back I was watching a video of a guy drawing a 3d drawing of Batman and I thought - That was awesome. So I decided that I'll draw Batman.

I personally think that 3D art is awesome and it's one of my favourite art styles. If you feel Batman is flying out of the paper, then I have achieved my goal.

Live Long and Prosper!
