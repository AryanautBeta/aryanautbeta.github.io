"The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light." - The Last Question, Issac Asimov

This short book re-tells the story of various succeeding generations of MultiVAC - a supercomputer featuring in many of legendary science fiction author Issac Asimov's short stories. Illustrated by Aryan Mahesh, the book attempts to visualise the original story.Â
