Hello everyone. Today I present another drawing. This is the sketch of the famous Will Smith playing  the role of Agent J in the trilogy of the 'Men In Black'. An MIB fan will definelty know what the title means. If you are a science fiction and comedy fan, and have not seen it, I recommend you watch this awesome trilogy. The camera tilted during the recording so you will see a horizontal tilt in the last part. Sorry about that. Anyway, here's the video.
