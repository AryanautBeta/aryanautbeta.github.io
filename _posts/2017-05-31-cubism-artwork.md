First things first, cubism has nothing to do with cubes. (Unlike my initial impression.) Cubism is completely different. Last week, my mom showed this video of an artist drew a realistic object look abstract. It looked like a bunch of simple shapes coloured in a pattern. But when you look closely you do see the objects. The objects themselves repeated all over the place. It looked kind of simple by just looking at it, but it actually wasn't. I browsed around and I found that was actually called _cubism_ and it was made famous by the artist Pablo Picasso. With my mom's help, I tried to create one of my own. I took a picture of a few things on my dad's desk and made a drawing. But before that, here's a little background on cubism.

Cubism started in Europe which brought modern art and sculptures to where it is today. It was created by Pablo Picasso in the early 20th century. It was one of the influencing art styles of the previous century . The cubist painters’ favorite thing to paint was usually still life objects like musical instruments or goblets or even people. Cubist landscapes were rare. Cubists used this art form to emphasise on the fact that their canvas is 2D, so they fractured their paintings to form simple geometric shapes.

Here’s how I made it.

I first made the basic outline of the photo on tracing paper so that when I repeat the shapes, they are uniform. Then I traced the shapes onto an A3 paper. I traced it repeatedly until it was spread across the sheet. Then I drew lines across the sheet which made it look fractured. After that I coloured it with colour pencils, making sure that the same colours don’t touch each other.

Here's the drawing:

Along with me my sister also made a cubist painting. Here it is

That’s all for today, and I leave you with a bit of Spock-Speak: Live Long and long Prosper!
