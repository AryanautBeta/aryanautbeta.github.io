For the past six months I've been writing a two part science fiction story. Finally in Feburary I released the first part on wattpad! 

## A little bit about the story -

It's the year 3100 and society now lives on three different planets. Things seem to be prospering but a chain of events is triggered when an introverted teenager and his two brothers finds a dangerous weapon which unlocks secrets of his family's past and leads to his father's mysterious dissapearence. As the veil is lifted, things about the very course of history are revealed to all be part of a grand plan.  
Two things before you read it - 
Remember all the charecters .  
Watch for which year it is.
