Hello everyone, and welcome back to another review. This time it is a movie review and not a book review. Anyway, I watched this awesome movie, _Star Wars : The Force Awakens_ and it was amazing! Now some of you who are reading this might not have watched the previous six movies. So I'll give you a quick brief.

**S_tar Wars 1: The Phantom Menace_** 

Young Anikan Skywalker meets a jedi master, Obi Wan Kenobi (after an evil 'sith' lord, Darth Maul assassinates Qui Gon Jin or Kenobi's master) and learns the ways of an invisible thing which jedi use called _the force_. But to learn the ways of the force, he had to be separated from his mother. Anikan comes to the jedi homeworld and befriends a man named Palpatine. He also becomes friends with a girl named Padme.

**S_tar Wars 2: Attack of the Clones_**

Now older, Anikan (trained by Obi Wan) learns to use a _lightsaber,_ a two foot long rod of some weird kind of energy powered by a crystal. He also learns that there is a Dark Side to the force and there is one main sith lord who threatens the existence  of the jedi. The sith's name was Darth Sidious. Anikan works with the jedi to track Sidious down.

**S_tar Wars 3: The Revenge of the Sith_**

Palpatine was kidnapped and Anikan went to the rescue. But Anikan discovered that a sith lord, Count Dookoo (I call him Count 'Cookoo'). When Anikan kills Dookoo, he becomes slightly evil. When he came back to the jedi home world, Anikan learns that Padme was pregnant and he was the father. He kept this a secret and continued to work with the jedi. Soon, a member of the jedi council, Mace Windu, learnt that the Chancellor Palpatine was the sith lord they were looking for the whole time. Palpatine was Darth Sidious. So Sidious tricked Anikan and made him kill Windu. Then Anikan turned to the Dark Side. He became the famous Darth Vader. In the meanwhile Padme dies giving birth to Luke and Leia Skywalker.

**S_tar Wars 4: A New Hope_**

Luke grows up to be a farm boy on Tatooine and had a peaceful life until two robots,         C-3P0 and R2D2,  were sold to him. A message from R2 showed Leia (who Luke was separated from at birth) asking for Obi Wan Kenobi. So Luke sets of on his speeder and finds Kenobi. Kenobi tells Luke about his real father and also said that Luke's father was dead. When R2 gives the message to Kenobi, he takes Luke to a bar and finds a trained pilot named Han Solo. Han flies Luke, Kenobi and Han's co- pilot Chewbacca or Chewie to the giant famous Death Star, a weapon so dangerous that it can obliterate planets. They rescue princess Leia but Kenobi is killed by Vader. The best part is where Luke destroys the Death Star, even though Vader escaped.

**S_tar Wars 5: The Empire strikes back_**

The Rebellion (where Luke is) now has settled on the icy planet Hoth while, Vader led by Sidious travels in his new stardestroyer to find Luke. Obi Wan's 'spirit' appears in front of him and tells him to go to the Dagobah system and seek further training from Yoda. When he goes there he learns that Han Solo and Leia are in danger and Vader was close to them. He also learns that Vader has plans for Solo and himself. So he travels to the cloud city where he realises that Vader was already there. They fight for a few minutes before Vader says the famous line known throughout the globe.

"Luke, I am your father."

Luke's right hand was cut off and Luke escaped by jumping on to the hovering Millennium Falcon and he is flown away knowing his true father.

**S_tar Wars 6: The Return of the Jedi_**

Luke Skywalker and the rebellion have learnt about the construction of the new Death Star. But they had a tactical advantage. Since the Death Star was still in construction the shields and the weapon systems will be brought online very slowly. So all they had to do is destroy the shields, which are projected by a mechanism on a nearby planet, and shoot a missile into the Death Star. Not so simple since the stardestroyer of Sidious was hovering nearby. Before that Luke returned to the Dagobah system and finishes his training. But sadly, Yoda passed away after training Luke. I will stop here because you have to watch the movie to get details.

**S_tar Wars 7: The Force Awakens_**

Many years after Vader, Luke has disappeared while two new people from the Dark Side emerge. Kyloren and The supreme councillor otherwise known as (as I call him) Potato-head-ugly-face. Anyway the surprise is that Kyloren's name is actually Ben and he is the son of someone I mentioned. If you have already watched the movie you will know who Kyloren's father is. I'm not telling anyone who hasn't watched. Anyway on the planet Jakku a young lady named Rey meets a not-evil clone named Fin after a droid BB-8 escapes a sinking starfighter. They learn about Kyloren and they also realise a new Death Star, made on the crust of a planet that has the capability to destroy a system of planets discluding the host star. Anyway Fin finds the Millennium Falcon and teams up with Han Solo and Chewbacca to find this new Death Star and blow it up, before it destroyed the Rebellion.

I really like the fact that they used the original title where it said

'Long ago in a galaxy far far away...'

It's a good thing they left it that way. I also really liked the part where the new Death Star is first used. It was totally awesome.

Ok, now I will do a comparison of the new Death Star to real life.

The Death Star is basically a planet with most of it modified into a giant weapon. In real life this wouldn't be possible for a very long time. We would need drills the size of China and the whole of humanity to build it. But maybe it can be built after we acquire the technology. In the movie, the Death Star has two main parts- the giant hole where the laser comes from and a storage device to store the energy. It collects its energy from a star and stores it in the giant storage device. When the weapon is ready, it shoots a giant spreading laser the size of the moon at its target. But the energy collected is so much that a small disturbance could make it explode and the energy (which came from the star) would first kill everything and then the planet would implode. That is exactly what Solo and the rebellion's X-Wing fighters did. They used Fin's information to disable the shields while the X-Wing fighters shot lasers at the storage device. But what confused me was the fact that the planet imploded and became a dwarf star. But now I think I know how. When the X-Wings were shooting the lasers, they were generating heat. They energy collected from stars would mainly be Hydrogen. When enough heat is generated, fusion occurs and Hydrogen atoms begin to collide and become Helium. So maybe, that's what happened. The Hydrogen in the storage device was so much that the planet started fusing Hydrogen atoms and became a star after it's implosion.

This was one of the best movies I ever watched. I would give it 5 stars out of 5. Thank you for reading my movie review. Keep looking for more.

By the way, here's a drawing I made of Kyloren.
