Hello again. This is Aryan Mahesh back to work. So I watched the Martian(starring Matt damon as Mark Watney) movie a few days back and I thought Matt Damon did a really nice job on his acting. And plus he is one of my favourite actors. So I thought I'll draw him with his EVA/ Space helmet on because it was a scene from the movie. And of course I drew him and took a time lapse using my iPod touch. I'll leave the video  and the martian trailer below. Hope you like it.
