[Youth For Parivarthan](https://www.youthforparivarthan.org.in/) started 6 years ago when Bangalore's title started to change from "The Garden City of India" to "The Garbage city of India". To change the city's image worldwide, they started this organisation. Apart from spot-fixes the organization also indulges in orphanage and old-age home visits, organizing drawing and other competitions for kids, organizing blood donation, health & dental check-up camps, awareness campaigns, RECYCLOTHON, voter awareness campaigns, traffic awareness campaigns, tree plantation drives, lake rejuvenation projects, etc.

Today I volunteered with them to repaint an old government primary school near South Bengaluru. It was a wonderful experience and I personally had a lot of fun painting on the walls. They do this for different spots every weekend and I reccomend it to all artists or just to anyone who wants to volunteer for a good cause.

That's all I have for now. Please check out Youth for Parivarthan and volunteer for their activities if you can.
