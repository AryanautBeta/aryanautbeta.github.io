Hello everyone. Cue lame excuse for not posting for a while! Yup. But I'm back. Anyway, today I'm posting another comic.

My school recently had a science exhibition. So I drew up a comic based on my experiments. Slightly inspired by the Buddha manga series and my taste for stick figures comes my first fully shaded comic strip. Here it is:

I called it Ninja Alchemy - combining the words Alchemy which is the old name for Chemistry and not related in any way to Fullmetal Alchemist - the popular anime released in the early 2000s and there is a ninja in it.

By the way the blue box in the comic does not spell NaCHOs (nachos),Â  it spells NaHCO3 (Sodium Bicarbonate).

Live Long And Prosper!
