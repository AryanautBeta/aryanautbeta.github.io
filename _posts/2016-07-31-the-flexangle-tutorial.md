Hello and welcome back to another tutorial. Sorry for not posting in a while (I had exams).

This tutorial is actually about a paper toy which also makes your desk look better. It's called the flexangle. The flexangle is like three triangles facing each other and when you pull from the middle the triangles change colour. I know I made that sound SUPER hard but it's not.

The template and the tutorial is in this post.
